                    <h3>Bullet Journal</h3>
                    <p>I try to set aside at least an hour each week to create daily planning spreads in my bullet journal. It's a hobby I personally find very therapeutic. 
                        I often go back to my old spreads to see what my past self has been up to. Through the years I've bullet journaled, I am able to reflect on my past self, which
                        I find integral to my personal growth.

                    <h3>Painting</h3>
                    <p>Oil painting has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was 11 years old. I am often inspired by natural landscapes and movement and 
                        try to incorporate these obersations in my paintings.

                    <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                    <p></p>Before high school, tampering with digital art was something
                        I found intimidating. I finally mustered some courage to start digital art with Autodesk Sketchbook after wanting to make illustrations for
                        a book I wanted to write at the time. I now do digital art for CopperInkCo, which as provided an outlet for me to slowly develop my personal digital art style!
